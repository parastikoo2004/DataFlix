**DataFlix: The OTT Intelligence Dashboard** 🔮

A comprehensive, multi-page Business Intelligence dashboard built in Python that analyzes and compares the content strategies of the world's top streaming platforms: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu.

This app transforms raw, siloed datasets into a high-performance, interactive tool for strategic analysis, complete with a "glassmorphism" UI, animated visualizations, and a live API connection to The Movie Database (TMDb).

✨ Core Features

This dashboard is a comprehensive BI tool that provides insights at both a macro (global market) and micro (platform-specific) level.

🌎 Global Market Overview: A high-level home page with aggregated KPIs (Total Titles, Top Genres) and an interactive market share chart.

🥊 Platform Head-to-Head: A dynamic comparison tool that lets you select any two platforms and see a side-by-side breakdown of their library size, content mix, and top genres.

🔴🔵✨🟢 Deep-Dive Dashboards: Four dedicated, multi-tab dashboards with 10-12 unique visualizations each, analyzing the specific content strategies of Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu.

📊 40+ Interactive Visualizations: A complete suite of animated charts built with Plotly, including:

Choropleth World Maps (Geographic Footprint)

Time-Series Area Charts (Content Growth)

Histograms (Movie Runtimes vs. TV Seasons)

Donut & Pie Charts (Content Mix)

Bar Charts (Top 10 Genres, Directors)

Treemaps & Funnel Charts (Rating Analysis)

Polar (Radar) Charts (Seasonal Trends)

🧠 Automated BI Insights Engine: An "AI-powered" recommendations panel on each dashboard that provides automated, data-driven strategic insights based on the visualized data.

📡 Live API Integration: A "Title Intelligence Terminal" powered by the TMDb API that allows you to:

Search for any movie or TV show to get its poster, overview, and rating.

Fetch current user reviews for any searched title.

View a live, auto-updating feed of the Top 10 Trending Movies.

🎶 Aesthetic UI/UX: A stunning custom-built "glassmorphism" dark theme, animated Lottie icons for KPIs, and a functional ambient music player in the sidebar.

🚀 How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/parastikoo2004/DataFlix.git]

4. Set Up Your API Key (CRITICAL)

This project requires a free API key from The Movie Database (TMDb) to power the search and trending features.

Go to themoviedb.org and create a free account.

Navigate to your account Settings → API.

Copy your API Key (v3 auth).

Create a new folder in the project's root directory named .streamlit.

Inside that .streamlit folder, create a new file named secrets.toml.

Add your key to that file like this:

TMDB_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_goes_here"


5. Run the App!

You're all set. Run the following command in your terminal:

streamlit run app.py
